NLP_assignment_2_README

To run tests of the system, run the A2_tests.py file, uncommenting which tests you want to run from the __init__ method. svm_classify and svm_learn will need to be downloaded into this folder with the appropriate packages from SVMlight depending on the OS

The datasets must be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1c_x_eeUcfoG3HlcQwaTBHC5M_ksxiOUZ?usp=sharing and moved into the same folder as A2_test.py

The large dataset for D2V must be downloaded into the same folder as A2_test.py in a folder called "assignment_2_large_dataset" with subfolders containing all the review files
